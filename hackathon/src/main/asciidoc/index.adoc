[introduction]
= Introduction

RESTful Original News is a RESTful web service for storing News in blockchain. It uses hypermedia
to describe the relationships between resources and to allow navigation between them.

[getting-started]
= Getting started



[getting-started-running-the-service]
== Running the service
RESTful Notes is written using http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot[Spring Boot] which
makes it easy to get it up and running so that you can start exploring the REST API.

The first step is to clone the Git repository:

[source,bash]
----
$ git clone https://github.com/bxliu/hackathon
----

Once the clone is complete, you're ready to get the service up and running:

[source,bash]
----
$ cd OriginalNews
$ ./mvn clean package
$ java -jar target/*.jar
----

You can check that the service is up and running by executing a simple request using
cURL:

include::{snippets}/index/1/curl-request.adoc[]

This request should yield the following response in the
http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html[Hypertext Application Language (HAL)] format:

include::{snippets}/index/1/http-response.adoc[]

Note the `_links` in the JSON response. They are key to navigating the API.



[getting-started-creating-a-site]
== Creating a site
Now that you've started the service and verified that it works, the next step is to use
it to create a new site. As you saw above, the URI for working with sites is included as
a link when you perform a `GET` request against the `sites` link of the service:

include::{snippets}/index/1/http-response.adoc[]

To create a site, you need to execute a `POST` request to this URI including a JSON
payload containing the title and body of the note:

include::{snippets}/creating-a-site/1/curl-request.adoc[]

The response from this request should have a status code of `201 Created` and contain a
`Location` header whose value is the URI of the newly created note:

include::{snippets}/creating-a-site/1/http-response.adoc[]

To work with the newly created note you use the URI in the `Location` header. For example,
you can access the note's details by performing a `GET` request:

include::{snippets}/creating-a-site/2/curl-request.adoc[]

This request will produce a response with the note's details in its body:

include::{snippets}/creating-a-site/2/http-response.adoc[]

Note the `news` link which we'll make use of later.



[getting-started-creating-a-news]
== Creating news
Creating news associated with generated site.

Referring back to the response for the service's index, the URI for working with news is
include as a link:

include::{snippets}/index/1/http-response.adoc[]

To create news you need to execute a `POST` request to this URI, including a JSON
payload containing these necessary properties of the news:

include::{snippets}/creating-a-site/3/curl-request.adoc[]

The response from this request should have a status code of `201 Created` and contain a
`Location` header whose value is the URI of the newly created news:

include::{snippets}/creating-a-site/3/http-response.adoc[]

To work with the newly created news you use the URI in the `Location` header. For example
you can access the news' details by performing a `GET` request:

include::{snippets}/creating-a-site/4/curl-request.adoc[]

This request will produce a response with the news' details in its body:

include::{snippets}/creating-a-site/4/http-response.adoc[]
